CS370 LAB 2

STUDENT NAME: Trevor Cargile
RED ID: 813542789

Hello. I completed every piece of this lab myself and wasn't in a group.

ZIPPED FILES:

lab2pt1.cct - Accepts the original 8 bits of data, creates the ECC Generator, and displays the 12 bit string in the specified format.

lab2pt2.cct - Accepts the 12 bit string from the previous part and applies error to it. Creates the "Data Transmission" part of the lab.

lab2pt3.cct - Accepts the new 12 bit string with an error and corrects it. Creates the "memory" part of the lab.

lab2tester.cct - Puts all circuits together for testing. NOTE: This was a single group project so my circuit doesn't support multiple errors.

lab2decoder.cct - A 4x16 decoder I made for the purpose of this lab.

tcargile_lab2.clf - The library I've created for lab2. This library contains the ECC Generator, the Data Transmission, and the Memory, as well
			as a 4x16 decoder I created for use in this lab.

I have extensive documentation in each cct file, so the descriptions here are brief.
