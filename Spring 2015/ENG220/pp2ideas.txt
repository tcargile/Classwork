Main ideas:

Oliver sacks focuses on the acknowledgement of self. People with prog can't recognize the faces. John Berger focuses not on the individual but rather the actions of
the individual and what they are wearing, sitting next to, etc. Losing sight changes the way we see, meaning we use other senses to imagine within our minds what our 
surroundings are like. John Berger focuses on the importance of images as a child, so both authors imagine things with different senses.
