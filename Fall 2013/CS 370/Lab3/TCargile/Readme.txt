Sequence #: 11011101

Hello. I completed every piece of this lab myself and wasn't in a group.

ZIPPED FILES:

lab3.cct -	The main logic behind the sequence recognizer. It contains the logic for the counter
		as well as the logic for each flip flop.

lab3_tester.cct - 	Tests the logic with the desired setup. There are two buttons on each input. Flipping to 1
			signifies that the button has been pressed. Reset is used to start the sequence
			recognizer initially or to reset the circuit.

tcargile_lab3.clf - 	Library file containing the sequence recognizer compact circuit.

I have extensive documentation in each cct file, so the descriptions here are brief.
